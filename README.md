**Design Document:
**

Modular design (Classes and structure): This covers what the overall structure of the project will be. It should cover all of your classes and how they are related. If you have only one class, it should list important methods that you will need. It should also cover how the user proceeds through the user interface. (That is, what happens on clicks, menu choices, etc.) (10 points)

 

Data structure:  This is a listing of the classes, structures (like ArrayLists), and fields (variables) that will be used to store data.  (10 points)

 

Algorithms:  Include the important algorithms (step-by-step methods) that will be used in your program. (10 points)

 

Prototype (Layout):  Create a VERY simplified version of the program that shows the layout. This could be done in Paint, Google Slides (and exported as an image), etc. Imagine that you are trying to convince your employer that you can actually complete this project. Otherwise you will get fired and have to live on the streets.  (10 points)


**Design Cycle: Group Project Overview
**

Code:

This is what percentage of your code is working.  The total of 100 points will vary based on what has been agreed upon with your design document.  If you only get 50% of the features done, you will get 50 points on the coding section.

 
Documentation:

Most of this score is around writing a user manual.  30 points will be on how readable your manual is.  It must cover EVERY feature of your program.  Screenshots are a good idea for demonstrating how to use it.  The other 20 points are commenting your code.

 

Points:

Code:  100 points

Documentation:  50 points

 

Total:  150 points
